This program uses the MediaPipe library for selfie segmentation to separate the foreground (person) from the background in an image or video stream, and it allows the user to interactively choose a custom background color.

Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - `cv2`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
   - `mediapipe`: A library for building applications around machine learning solutions.

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np
import time
```

2. **Initialize MediaPipe Components:**
   - `mp_drawing`: MediaPipe drawing utilities.
   - `mp_selfie_segmentation`: MediaPipe selfie segmentation solution.

```python
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
mp_selfie_segmentation = mp.solutions.selfie_segmentation
```

3. **Configuration:**
   - Set the path for the input image (`image_path`) and whether to use a webcam (`use_webcam`).
   - Set the default and selected background colors.

```python
image_path = "image/person2.jpeg"
use_webcam = False  # Set to True to use a webcam
bg_color = (0, 64, 128)  # Default background color
color_selected = False
selected_color = bg_color
```

4. **Color Exploration:**
   - Define functions and variables for capturing and exploring colors.

```python
# Functions and variables for color exploration
# (on_mouse_click, getColor, color_explore, color_selected)
```

5. **Mouse Click Event Handling:**
   - Capture the color at the clicked point and save it to a file (`color.txt`).
   - Right-click to print the selected color in hexadecimal format.

```python
cv2.setMouseCallback('MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation', on_mouse_click)
```

6. **Initialize MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation Model:**
   - Start the selfie segmentation model.

```python
with mp_selfie_segmentation.SelfieSegmentation(model_selection=0) as selfie_segmentation:
```

7. **Main Loop:**
   - Continuously process frames from the webcam or image.
   - Extract the segmentation mask and apply it to the frame.
   - Read the selected color from the `color.txt` file and use it as the custom background.
   - Display the output with information on the selected color and frames per second (FPS).

```python
while True:
    # Main processing loop
    # ...
```

8. **Key Handling:**
   - Press 'Esc' to exit the application.

```python
key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
if key == 27:  # Press Esc to exit
    break
```

9. **Cleanup:**
   - Destroy all OpenCV windows when the application is terminated.

```python
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Note: This program uses selfie segmentation, allowing users to choose a background color by clicking on it. The selected color is displayed and saved to a file, and the background of the segmented person is replaced with the selected color in real-time. The FPS and selected color information are also displayed on the output window.
